        <!--A way to speed up copying and pasting so many entries is by using the short cut of selecting multiple columns and pasting part 
        of the entries you need to code. 
    
        This is done by pressing and holding shift + alt and then descending or upscending through the columns and till the desired end point
        and pasting or writing whatever piece of semi repetive code you want.  
    
        Because usually the column formatting is alittle awkward combine the use of shift + alt with ctrl + shift + i to format all your code 
        automatically. -->

    <h2 class="sub-methods">Method</h2>
    <ol class="ordered">
        <li>Add some olive oil to a large pot over medium high heat, and add the beef, pork, and veal.
            Cook to render the fat out of it, and strain it over a large bowl. Set aside the meat and the fat.
        </li>
        <li>Using some of the reserved fat, add 1 chopped onion, 1 large chopped carrot, and 2 celery stalks. You can
            also add a few optional shakes of red pepper flakes if you're feelign saucy (pun intended), and a healthy
            pinch
            of oregano. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add 4 cloves of garlic and saute for one minute. Degalze mixture with 2 cups of wine, scraping
            the delicious fond off of the bottom of the pot before adding back meat mixture.
        </li>
        <!--Don't forget that some symbols here like fractions or degrees symbols have there own apporiate encoding, and you need to first 
        see if that symbol actually exist in html (which it probably does) and then find the value that you have to use in order to tell the 
        browser that you want to display that symbol on your webpage.
    
        Below I have an example &frasl; which returns a value of dividor but at an angle with the numator on top of the angled dividtor 
        and the denomantor diagonaly lower to the right of the numator.-->
        <li>Add 2 cups of homemade chicken stock or chicken stock in which you've dissolved a packet of gelatin,
            alogn with one 28 ounce can of peeled whole tomateos, one 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes, some chopped
            sage, a few sprigs of fresh basil, 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of milk, and two bay leaves. Stir
            to
            combine.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and slow simmer sauce for 4 hours. Alternatively, you could also bake the sauce with the lid partially
            open in a 325&deg;F
            oven for about 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Once everything is thick and cohesive, remove sprigs of basil, and add <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup
            of
            freshly chopped basil,
            <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup of heavy cream, and 3 ounces of grated parmesan. Stir to combine. Seasos
            with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Set on the back burner and start working on your fresh pasta.

        <!--Another moment were I had to write a specific html value (or code) to get the degree symbol-->
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375&deg;F
        </li>
        <li>Once your dough is rolled out start layering your baking dish. First layer sauce, then pasta, then
            mozzarella cheese, then
            ricotta cheese. Repeat this until you reach the top and add some grated parmesan cheese. Place baking dish
            on a
            baking sheet and cook in
            your oven for 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove from oven, let cool for 30 minutes. Dig in and enjoy!</li>
