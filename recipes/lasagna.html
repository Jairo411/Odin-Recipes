        1. Add some olive oil to a large pot over medium high heat, and add the beef, pork, and veal.
        Cook to render the fat out of it, and strain it over a large bowl. Set aside the meat and the fat.

        2. Using some of the reserved fat, add 1 chopped onion, 1 large chopped carrot, and 2 celery stalks. You can
        also add a few optional shakes of red pepper flakes if you're feelign saucy (pun intended), and a healthy pinch
        of oregano. Stir to combine.

        3. Add 4 cloves of garlic and saute for one minute. Degalze mixture with 2 cups of wine, scraping
        the delicious fond off of the bottom of the pot before adding back meat mixture.

        alogn with one 28 ounce can of peeled whole tomateos, one 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes, some chopped
        sage, a few sprigs of fresh basil, 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of milk, and two bay leaves. Stir to
        combine.

        5.Cover and slow simmer sauce for 4 hours. Alternatively, you could also bake the sauce with the lid partially
        open in a 325&deg;F
        oven for about 4 hours.

        6.Once everything is thick and cohesive, remove sprigs of basil, and add <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup of
        freshly chopped basil,
        <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup of heavy cream, and 3 ounces of grated parmesan. Stir to combine. Seasos
