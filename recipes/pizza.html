        Pizza is top 10 for sure. Now there are many different types of pizza out there some with<br />
        pepperioni, some with red and green peppers, some with mushrooms, etc. The pizza is possibly<br />

        put on it. But here I would like to present to you, the standard margherita pizza.<br />

                            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature

                            it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm

                            Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them.
                            For each
                            portion, start<br />
                            with the right side of the dough and pull it towards the center; then do the same with the
                            left,
                            then

                            the bottom(the order doesn't actually matter; what you want is four folds). SHape each

                            side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if
                            they are,
                            dust
