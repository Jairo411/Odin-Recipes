    <h2>Method: Pizza</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, active dry yeast, and salt. Add the water and, with a wooden
            spoon or<br />
            your hands, mix thoroughly.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature for 18 hours or
            unti<br />
            it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them. For each portion, start<br/>
            with the right side of the dough and pull it towards the center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then<br/>
            the bottom(the order doesn't actually matter; what you want is four folds). SHape each portion into a round and turn seam<br/>
            side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            if you don't intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days<br/>
            Return to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.
        </li>
    </ol>

            minute. Add some<br />
            red pepper flakes and let those cook for about 10-15 seconds.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Add a 28-ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Stir in and lightly break up the tomatoes. Add some
            dry onion powder<br />
            alnog with soem dry oregano, sitr to combine and let simmer for 30-45 minutes.

            Slowly start to pat the dough down into the general shape of a pizza. Don't roll it out with a rolling pin.
            Once the dough<br />
            had grown in size, pass over your knuckles and slowly start to spread it out until a pizza pie shape is
            formed.
